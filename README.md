# COVID-19 Tracker and Analysis

A data analysis project to explore and visualize COVID-19 trends, including cases, deaths, and vaccination progress across selected countries.

## Objectives

- Analyze COVID-19 data to identify trends and patterns.
- Visualize key metrics such as total cases, deaths, and vaccination progress.
- Highlight anomalies and provide actionable insights.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: Advanced data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for analysis.

## How to Run/View the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd covid_tracker_project

3. Install the required libraries
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook
   jupyter notebook covid_data_analysis.ipynb

5. Run the cells sequentially to view the analysis and visualizations.

## Insights and Reflections

Vaccination Rollout: The United States had the fastest vaccine rollout among the selected countries.
Daily New Cases: India experienced the highest spikes in daily new cases, indicating potential waves of infections.
Death Rates: Kenya maintained a relatively lower death rate compared to the United States and India.
Vaccination Progress: India showed significant progress in vaccinating its population but lagged behind the United States in fully vaccinated individuals.
Anomalies: Missing or inconsistent data were handled during preprocessing to ensure accurate analysis.

## Future Improvements

Incorporate interactive visualizations using tools like Plotly or Dash.
Expand the analysis to include more countries and metrics.
Automate data updates for real-time tracking.
